All you need to create your own pillow stroker is:

2 pillows, bed pillows work best
2 belts
Place your pillows side-by-side on a flat surface. Next, slide one belt under the top 1/3 of the pillows and the second belt under the bottom 1/3.

Then, adjust the belts tightly, around both pillows â€“ you may need to make additional holes on the belts so you can adjust them to a smaller size.

Finally, slide your Fleshlight in between the pillows and you have a hands-free DIY pillow stroker!

How you use a Fleshlight with your pillow stroker is entirely up to you! Lay it flat on the bed, in the corner of a chair or against your headboard.
