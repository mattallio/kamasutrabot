DILDO:
Itâ€™s one of those good dildo positions that allow you to lie down in a comfortable position with easy access to your clit. To prolong the play, you can start the session by applying lube and massaging your vagina for more pleasure. Choose the least sensitive area and gradually move onto the clitoris. It will help you build up the excitement and maximize the enjoyment. While fingering might strain your wrist, using a dildo can be a lot more comfortable and give you more intense sensations, especially if you go for a vibrating dildo. Lift your hips as you masturbate so it can directly stimulate your G-spot.
