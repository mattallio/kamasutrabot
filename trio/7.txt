One person lies on their back underneath the vulva-owning partner, who's also on their back. The other partner penetrates them in the missionary position. Have the person with the bigger penis be in the backdoor, because the angle makes it’s more likely he’s going to slip out. Both penis-owners should not attempt to thrust at the same time, because if you do, one of you will slip out almost immediately.
